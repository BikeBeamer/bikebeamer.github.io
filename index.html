            <p>
                BikeBeamer produces beautiful full-color images and animations right in your bike spokes. Capable of
                showing over 16.9 million colors in its 70 cm wide circular canvas, it's sure to look stunning with
                everything it displays.

            </p>
            <p>
                256 high power LEDs placed across both sides of its 4 blades, each with a luminous intensity of over
                2200 mcd, allow for unprecented visibility everywhere. Once the sun starts to set, BikeBeamer starts to
                shine and aims to keep you safe.
            </p>
            <h3>Easily customizable on the go</h3>

            <p>
                Based on the popular ESP32 development platform it is easily customizable on the go via a simple to use
                and straightforward web interface. Access it from any modern device with a web browser and start using
                your own designs - no software installation needed.

            </p>
            <p>
                Taking customization even further, BikeBeamer is fully open source and designed to be hacked and
                extended. All the CAD and code is available allowing anyone to experiment with and improve upon it - all
                to make it truely your own.

            <p>
                BikeBeamer is a passion project of mine into which countless hours, not to say weekends went. I'm really
                happy with how it has turned out and love the never ending first time reactions of people when driving
                around with it. However, just because it suits my needs for now, doesn't implicate that it is finished
                by means.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being based on popular components and having good documentation (at least for my standards ðŸ™ƒ), you are
                welcome to make it your own, improve on my work and contribute to the project. I would love this to
                become a community effort, so check out the GitHub repository and start implementing your own features
                right now:

                If your are not a maker kind of person yourself, but still want to share your thoughts, feel free to
                open a GitHub issue or write a comment down below with your ideas and wishes. I or someone else might
                see it and start working on it...

            <h2 id="buy">Buy</h2>
            <p>
                BikeBeamer is not currently available for purchase, since I really can't estimate the public interest in
                it, but you can join the waitlist and once enough people sign up I might do a small production run:
